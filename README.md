[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skgrange/rmweather.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skgrange/rmweather)

## Introduction

**rmweather** is an R package to conduct meteorological/weather normalisation on air quality so trends and interventions can be investigated in a robust way. 

## Installation

To install the development version the [**devtools**](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package will need to be installed first. Then:

```
# Load helper package
library(devtools)

# Install metnormr
install_github("skgrange/rmweather")
```

The lightweight **ghit** package can also be used for installation if you prefer: 

```
# Install metmormr
ghit::install_github("skgrange/rmweather")
```
